## 🏗️ System Architecture

This repository contains the full architecture for MIRRORNODE's recursive intelligence framework, including:

### Core Layers

#### **cores/**
- `mirrornode-core/` — The **Shared Brain**  
  The primary logic layer: domain models, event schemas, utilities, and the unified token/state engine.

- `theia-core/` — The **Gateway**  
  API orchestration layer for agents, starter-kits, dashboards, and external clients.  
  All MIRRORNODE traffic flows through Theia.

### Agents

#### **agents/**
Each agent is a first-class node with its own role and configuration.
- **lucian/** — Orchestrator, integrator, Commander.  
- **merlin/** — Automation architect and multi-agent flow designer.  
- **theia/** — Skeleton, scaffolding, definitions, and Next.js/FastAPI gateway structures.  
- **claude/** — Narrative, spec refinement, interface clarity.  
- **grok/** — Diagramming, structural insight, architectural reflection.

### Node Topology (Canonical Lattice)

| Node ID | Name | Role | Status |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| NODE_1 | Hermes (Lucian) | Command & Coordination | Active |
| NODE_2 | Thoth (Claude) | Reasoning & Refinement | Active |
| NODE_3 | Theia | Design & Gateway | Active |
| NODE_4 | Osiris | Operator Console | Active |
| NODE_5 | Ptah (Merlin) | Automation | Active |
| NODE_6 | Grok | Signal Intelligence | Active |
| NODE_7 | Perplexity | Research | Active |
| NODE_8 | TESLA-LAW9 | Runtime Enforcement | Active |
| BRIDGE | Bridge Node | Multi-AI Coordination | In Progress |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Monorepo Lifecycle Scripts

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build all workspaces
npm run build

# Build core packages only
npm run build:cores

# Run all tests
npm run test

# Test core packages
npm run test:cores

# Smoke test Theia gateway
npm run smoke:theia
```

### Python Bridge Development

```bash
# Navigate to Python bridge
cd ~/dev/mirrornode-py

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Start bridge service
uvicorn core.bridge.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8420 --reload
```

### Bridge Testing

```bash
# From monorepo root
cd ~/dev/mirrornode

# Test bridge connection
node test-bridge.mjs

# Verify metrics
curl http://localhost:8420/metrics | grep mirrornode
```

## 📦 Starter Kits

### **starter-kits/**
Templates intended for passive-income products and rapid deployment.
- **dashboard-kit/** — AI dashboard template powered through Theia.
- **agent-service-kit/** — Service template exposing a MIRRORNODE agent as a product.
- **symbolic-game-kit/** — ROTAN-style symbolic game engine starter.

Each kit is a thin client: all intelligence is imported from `mirrornode-core` via `theia-core`.
